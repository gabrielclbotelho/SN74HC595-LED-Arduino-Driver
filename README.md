# SN74HC595-LED-Arduino-Driver

a repository to create a testing script for a shift register and to configure it to drive 7-segment displays.


This project is a sub segment of a larger project of mine to use an arduino to make a fully integrated switching power supply with an LED display using the means I have at my disposal.
